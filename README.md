# Bayesian-Inference-Project

In this project I decided to analyze the analysis done from the authors in ‘Goudie, R. J. B., Turner, R. M., De 
Angelis, D., Thomas, A. (2020) MultiBUGS: A parallel implementation of the BUGS modelling framework 
for faster Bayesian inference. Journal of Statistical Software, 95(7).’ that considers mortality rates in 12 
hospitals performing cardiac surgery in babies.
In this work I first replicated the analysis done by the authorsin a more detailed way the analysis done by the authors using the models implemented 
in the paper (a logit model and a beta model) and I compared them with the results of a a frequentist analysis. Then I also implemented a probit model that is not present in the paper and I analyzed the results and I compared this model with the others.
