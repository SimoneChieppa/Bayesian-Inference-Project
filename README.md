# Bayesian-Inference-Project

In this project I decided to analyze the analysis done from the authors in ‘Goudie, R. J. B., Turner, R. M., De 
Angelis, D., Thomas, A. (2020) MultiBUGS: A parallel implementation of the BUGS modelling framework 
for faster Bayesian inference. Journal of Statistical Software, 95(7).’ that considers mortality rates in 12 
hospitals performing cardiac surgery in babies.
