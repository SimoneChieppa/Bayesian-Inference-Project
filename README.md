# Bayesian-Inference-Project

In this project, my aim was to analyze the insights provided by the authors in 'Goudie, R. J. B., Turner, R. M., De Angelis, D., Thomas, A. (2020) MultiBUGS: A parallel implementation of the BUGS modelling framework for faster Bayesian inference. Journal of Statistical Software, 95(7).' The study focuses on mortality rates in 12 hospitals specializing in cardiac surgery for infants.

To begin, I replicated the authors' analysis by employing the models outlined in their paper, namely a logit model and a beta model. Subsequently, I compared the outcomes of these models with the results obtained through a frequentist analysis. Additionally, I extended the investigation by introducing a probit model, not originally featured in the paper. I thoroughly examined the results of this model and conducted a comparative analysis against the other models.
